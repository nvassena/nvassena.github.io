I am a postdoc in mathematics at the [Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics](https://www.izbi.uni-leipzig.de) at Leipzig University, hosted by the [Bioinformatics group](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de) of [Peter Stadler](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~studla/). I am a member of the Walter Benjamin Program of the DFG (German research society), leading a project on *Zero-eigenvalue bifurcations in Chemical Reaction Networks*. Before, I did my Ph.D. at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, in the [Nonlinear Dynamics group](http://dynamics.mi.fu-berlin.de), under the supervision of [Bernold Fiedler](http://dynamics.mi.fu-berlin.de/persons/fiedler.php). 

My research currently focuses on structural network conditions for the occurrence of bifurcations in dynamical systems arising from biochemical and ecological networks. 

For more details, please refer to my publications and CV. Feel free to contact me at nicola.vassena (at) uni-leipzig.de.  



**NEWS:**  
Together with Alex Blokhuis, Wei-Hsiang Lin, Praful Gagrani, I am organizing an interdisciplinary seminar series centered on autocatalysisis in reaction networks.
